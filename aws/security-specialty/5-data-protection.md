- Designing automatic lifecycle management for AWS services and resources (for example, Amazon S3, EBS volume snapshots, RDS volume snapshots, AMIs, container images, CloudWatch log groups, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager) :large_orange_diamond:
- Establishing schedules and retention for AWS Backup across AWS services :large_orange_diamond:

## Task Statement 5.4: Design and implement controls to protect credentials, secrets, and cryptographic key materials

**Knowledge of:**

- Secrets Manager :white_check_mark:
- Systems Manager Parameter Store :large_orange_diamond:
- Usage and management of symmetric keys and asymmetric keys (for example, AWS KMS) :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Designing management and rotation of secrets for workloads (for example, database access credentials, API keys, IAM access keys, AWS KMS customer managed keys) :white_check_mark:
- Designing KMS key policies to limit key usage to authorized users :white_check_mark:
- Establishing mechanisms to import and remove customer-provided key
material :white_check_mark:

  - This alarm uses the **SecondsUntilKeyMaterialExpires** metric that AWS KMS publishes to CloudWatch for KMS keys with imported key material that expires. Each alarm uses this metric to monitor the imported key material for a particular KMS key. You cannot create a single alarm for all KMS keys with expiring key material or an alarm for KMS keys that you might create in the future.

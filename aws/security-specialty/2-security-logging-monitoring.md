# Domain 2 - Security Logging & Monitoring

This section covers domain 2 of the AWS Security Specialty certification.

## Task Statement 2.1: Design and implement monitoring and alerting to address security events

**Knowledge of:**

- AWS services that monitor events and provide alarms (for example, CloudWatch, EventBridge) :white_check_mark:
- AWS services that automate alerting (for example, Lambda, Amazon Simple Notification Service [Amazon SNS], Security Hub) :white_check_mark:
- Tools that monitor metrics and baselines (for example, GuardDuty, Systems Manager) :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Analyzing architectures to identify monitoring requirements and sources of data for security monitoring :white_check_mark:
- Analyzing environments and workloads to determine monitoring requirements :white_check_mark:
- Designing environment monitoring and workload monitoring based on business and security requirements :white_check_mark:
- Setting up automated tools and scripts to perform regular audits (for example, by creating custom insights in Security Hub) :red_circle:
- Defining the metrics and thresholds that generate alerts :white_check_mark:

## Task Statement 2.2: Troubleshoot security monitoring and alerting

**Knowledge of:**

- Configuration of monitoring services (for example, Security Hub) :white_check_mark:
- Relevant data that indicates security events :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Analyzing the service functionality, permissions, and configuration of resources after an event that did not provide visibility or alerting :white_check_mark:
- Analyzing and remediating the configuration of a custom application that is not reporting its statistics :white_check_mark:
- Evaluating logging and monitoring services for alignment with security requirements :white_check_mark:

## Task Statement 2.3: Design and implement a logging solution

**Knowledge of:**

- AWS services and features that provide logging capabilities (for example, VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Logs) :white_check_mark:
- Attributes of logging capabilities (for example, log levels, type, verbosity) :white_check_mark:
- Log destinations and lifecycle management (for example, retention period) :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Configuring logging for services and applications :white_check_mark:
- Identifying logging requirements and sources for log ingestion :white_check_mark:
- Implementing log storage and lifecycle management according to AWS best practices and organizational requirements :white_check_mark:

## Task Statement 2.4: Troubleshoot logging solutions

**Knowledge of:**

- Capabilities and use cases of AWS services that provide data sources (for example, log level, type, verbosity, cadence, timeliness, immutability) :white_check_mark:
- AWS services and features that provide logging capabilities (for example, VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs, CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs) :white_check_mark:
- Access permissions that are necessary for logging :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Identifying misconfiguration and determining remediation steps for absent access permissions that are necessary for logging (for example, by managing read/write permissions, S3 bucket permissions, public access, and integrity) :white_check_mark:
- Determining the cause of missing logs and performing remediation steps:white_check_mark:

## Task Statement 2.5: Design a log analysis solution

**Knowledge of:**

- Services and tools to analyze captured logs (for example, Athena, CloudWatch Logs filter) :white_check_mark:
- Log analysis features of AWS services (for example, CloudWatch Logs Insights, CloudTrail Insights, Security Hub insights) :large_orange_diamond:
- Log format and components (for example, CloudTrail logs) :large_orange_diamond:

**Skills in:**

- Identifying patterns in logs to indicate anomalies and known threats :white_check_mark:
- Normalizing, parsing, and correlating logs :white_check_mark:

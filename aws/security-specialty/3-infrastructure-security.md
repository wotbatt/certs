- Defining layers of defense by combining edge security services (for example, CloudFront with AWS WAF and load balancers) :white_check_mark:
- Applying restrictions at the edge based on various criteria (for example, geography, geolocation, rate limit) :white_check_mark:
- Activating logs, metrics, and monitoring around edge services to indicate attacks :white_check_mark:

## Task Statement 3.2: Design and implement network security controls

**Knowledge of:**

- VPC security mechanisms (for example, security groups, network ACLs, AWS Network Firewall) :white_check_mark:
- Inter-VPC connectivity (for example, AWS Transit Gateway, VPC endpoints) :white_check_mark:
- Security telemetry sources (for example, Traffic Mirroring, VPC Flow Logs) :white_check_mark:
- VPN technology, terminology, and usage :white_check_mark:
- On-premises connectivity options (for example, AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect) :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Implementing network segmentation based on security requirements (for example, public subnets, private subnets, sensitive VPCs, on-premises connectivity) :white_check_mark:
- Designing network controls to permit or prevent network traffic as required (for example, by using security groups, network ACLs, and Network Firewall) :white_check_mark:
- Designing network flows to keep data off the public internet (for example, by using Transit Gateway, VPC endpoints, and Lambda in VPCs) :white_check_mark:
- Determining which telemetry sources to monitor based on network design, threats, and attacks (for example, load balancer logs, VPC Flow Logs, Traffic Mirroring) :white_check_mark:

## Task Statement 3.3: Design and implement security controls for compute workloads

**Knowledge of:**

- Provisioning and maintenance of EC2 instances (for example, patching, inspecting, creation of snapshots and AMIs, use of EC2 Image Builder) :white_check_mark:
- IAM instance roles and IAM service roles :white_check_mark:
- Services that scan for vulnerabilities in compute workloads (for example, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Elastic Container Registry [Amazon ECR]) :white_check_mark:
- Host-based security (for example, firewalls, hardening) :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Creating hardened EC2 AMIs :white_check_mark:
- Applying instance roles and service roles as appropriate to authorize compute workloads :white_check_mark:
- Scanning EC2 instances and container images for known vulnerabilities :white_check_mark:
- Applying patches across a fleet of EC2 instances or container images :white_check_mark:
- Activating host-based security mechanisms (for example, host-based firewalls) :white_check_mark:
- Analyzing Amazon Inspector findings and determining appropriate mitigation techniques :white_check_mark:
- Passing secrets and credentials securely to compute workloads :white_check_mark:

## Task Statement 3.4: Troubleshoot network security

**Knowledge of:**

- How to analyze reachability (for example, by using VPC Reachability Analyzer and Amazon Inspector) :white_check_mark:
- Fundamental TCP/IP networking concepts (for example, UDP compared with TCP, ports, Open Systems Interconnection [OSI] model, network operating system utilities) :white_check_mark:
- How to read relevant log sources (for example, Route 53 logs, AWS WAF logs, VPC Flow Logs) :white_check_mark:

**Skills in:**

- Identifying, interpreting, and prioritizing problems in network connectivity (for example, by using Amazon Inspector Network Reachability) :large_orange_diamond:
- Determining solutions to produce desired network behavior :white_check_mark:
- Analyzing log sources to identify problems :white_check_mark:
- Capturing traffic samples for problem analysis (for example, by using Traffic Mirroring) :white_check_mark:

## IAM

### Automate rotation of access keys

- Develop a Lambda function that calls the [GenerateCredentialReport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateCredentialReport.html) API to generate the credential report.
- Configure the function to use GetCredentialReport API to download the report, parse the CSV file and check the keys with a [access_key_1_last_rotated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/access-keys-rotated.html) of more than 90 days.
- Disable the old access keys using the [UpdateAccessKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAccessKey.html) API.

## GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty can generate findings based on suspicious activities such as requests coming from known malicious IP addresses, changing of bucket policies/ACLs to expose an S3 bucket publicly, or suspicious API call patterns that attempt to discover misconfigured bucket permissions.
